## Why start a blog when everyone is into videos? 
Well, not everyone agrees to that. I personally find myself more and more reading blogposts and articles in the internet rather than watch a video. This is true especially when it comes to programing tutorials or something new I want to tackle tech-wise.

This blog is written under the Vercel platform and all the source-code is available in Github. If you find something worth improving in some of my articles, fell free to open a PR. Your name will be featured at the end of the text.

That's all for today. See you in the next post.
